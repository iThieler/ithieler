<sub> Welcome to my profile page. My name is Michael Thiel, I am 38 years old and I am from Rheinland-Pfalz in Germany. My main job is a system administrator, hence my nickname iThieler. In my spare time I'm into IT networks in general, home automation and everything related to it and server virtualization. </sub>

<sub> Primarily, I created this collection of scripts to make setting up proxmox servers easier and also faster for me. I use gitHub to channel and manage my ideas and elaborations. It's nothing professional, so let me say, if you use my scripts, do so at your own risk. Test them before you use this productively. Always remember to use due diligence when sourcing scripts and automation tasks from third party websites. </sub>

<sub> If you want to contribute, you can join discussions [here](https://github.com/iThieler/iThieler/discussions), and maybe help one or two with their problems. If you want to support me in my work, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/U7U3FUTLF), or [get in touch](javascript:location.href = 'mailto:' + ['email','ithieler.de'].join('@') if you want to actively contribute. </sub>
